# readME Generator

This readME generator was built using node.js and inquirer to help users create a streamline process of generating a readME file for any project. Users are able to input a title, project description, and much more through a series of prompts located in their terminal. Once finished, a readME file will be created for the user in the local folder. Additionally, a badge at the top will list the license the user is using for their project!
